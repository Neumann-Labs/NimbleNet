# NimbleNet
NimbleNet is a lightweight, optimized Neural Network Framework written from scratch in C++.

## Roadmap/Architecture:

1. **Core Components**:
   - Tensor Library: Implement a basic tensor library that supports multi-dimensional arrays, element-wise operations, broadcasting, and memory management.
   - Autograd Engine: Develop an automatic differentiation system that enables the computation of gradients for backpropagation. Implement techniques like reverse-mode autodiff and support for dynamic computation graphs.
   - Operator Library: Build a collection of fundamental neural network operators such as convolution, pooling, activation functions, and loss functions. Optimize these operators for performance.

2. **Neural Network Layers**:
   - Implement common neural network layers such as fully connected, convolutional, recurrent (RNN, LSTM, GRU), and attention layers.
   - Provide a flexible and intuitive API for defining and composing neural network architectures.

3. **Optimization and Training**:
   - Implement popular optimization algorithms like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.
   - Support techniques like learning rate scheduling, momentum, and regularization.
   - Implement training utilities such as data loaders, batch normalization, and model checkpointing.

4. **Hardware Acceleration**:
   - Explore ways to leverage hardware acceleration using libraries like CUDA or OpenCL for GPU support.
   - Implement optimized kernels for common operations to take advantage of hardware parallelism.
   - Consider supporting multiple backends (CPU, GPU, etc.) with a unified interface.

5. **Serialization and Deployment**:
   - Develop a serialization format for saving and loading trained models.
   - Provide tools for model deployment and inference in various environments (e.g., C++ applications, Python bindings).

6. **Compiler Optimizations**:
   - Profiling and benchmarking: Continuously profile and benchmark the framework to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize critical paths.
   - Memory optimization: Implement techniques like memory pooling and efficient memory management to minimize memory overhead.
   - Investigate techniques for graph-level optimizations, such as operator fusion and constant folding.
   - Explore methods for automatic code generation and optimization based on hardware characteristics.
   - Study the approaches used in projects like XLA and Apache TVM for inspiration.

8. **Interoperability and Ecosystem (optional)**:
   - Consider providing Python bindings or a Python frontend to make the framework accessible to a wider audience.
   - Explore integration with popular machine learning ecosystems like NumPy, Pandas, or scikit-learn.

9. **Testing and Documentation**:
   - Develop a comprehensive test suite to ensure the correctness and stability of NimbleNet.
   - Provide clear and detailed documentation, including tutorials and API references.
